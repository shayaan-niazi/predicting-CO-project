# Predictive Modeling of Atmospheric Carbon Monoxide Concentrations

Project Overview

This project aims to predict atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations using linear regression. Such predictions are vital for enhancing air quality monitoring and urban planning efforts.

Data Source and Cleaning

We utilized a comprehensive dataset, implementing thorough cleaning procedures to ensure data quality, including the removal of outliers and handling of missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our EDA provided valuable insights into the dataset, revealing key variable distributions and their relationships, which informed our modeling approach.

Model Selection and Training
Linear regression was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness. The model was trained with 80% of the dataset, ensuring a robust learning process.

Evaluation

We evaluated the model's performance using RMSE and MAE, which indicated a high level of accuracy in predicting CO concentrations.

Key Findings

Important predictors identified include NOx(GT) and PT08.S1(CO), highlighting their significant role in CO concentration levels.

Conclusion and Future Work

The project demonstrates the potential of linear regression in environmental modeling. Future work could explore more complex models or additional predictive variables to enhance accuracy.
